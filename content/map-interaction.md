# Map Interaction

The interaction seen in web maps is powered by **JavaScript**. There are JavaScript libraries for ALL SORTS of things, and we're using Leaflet as a foundation for our maps. However you can add customization to your map so that it can do just about anything (remember those plugins?).    

For this workshop, we're not creating any new code or writing new scripts. We're just going to copy and paste some pre-assembled text so that you can see how it works to affect your map.
