# Hands On: Build Your Own Web Map

# Putting it into Perspective
Before we start working on our map, let's just put things into perspective. This is an introductory workshop, and meant to get you started with the tools and give you the skills to move forward on your own. Within the greater web mapping ecosystem, we're touching on the essentials. And give you an idea of how what we are doing fits into that ecosystem, take a [look at this diagram from Maptime](http://maptime.io/anatomy-of-a-web-map/#84), and notice the <HTML> document, and the internet browser.
## Software Used
We'll use two pieces of software - a web browser, which will render/display your map, and a source code editor to edit that map.
## Development Environment
First things first, let's set up your development environment which includes the two pieces of software, and a method for you to access them both efficiently. One option is to split your screen in half - web browser on one side and the code editor on another. Or, you can move from one application tab to another by minimizing windows. It's totally your call, and the point is to find out what works best for you.
