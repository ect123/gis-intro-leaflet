# Hands On: Build Your Own Web Map

Before we start working on our map, let’s put things into perspective: This is an introductory workshop meant to get you started with the tools and skills to move forward on your own. Within the greater web mapping ecosystem context, we’re touching on the essentials. To give you an idea of where this workshop fits into that ecosystem, take a look at this diagram from [Maptime](http://maptime.io/). Note the .html document and the internet browser. 

## Set-up
If you haven't already, download the workshop data now and **extract the contents of the .zip file**.
[Download Data](content/intro-leaflet-data.zip){: .btn .btn-blue }

In addition, we'll use two pieces of software: a web browser, which will render/display your map, and a source code editor to edit that map.

## Development Environment
First things first, let's set up your development environment with the two pieces of software, and a method for you to access them both efficiently. One option is to split your screen in half - web browser on one side and the code editor on another. Or, you can move from one application tab to another by minimizing windows. It's totally your call, and the point is to find out what works best for you.
