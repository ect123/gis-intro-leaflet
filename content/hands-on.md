# Hands On

This section will guide you through building an interactive web map powered by Leaflet. To begin, we will look at the code that loads a basemap in order to understand what each element does. Next, we will add data to this basemap and, building upon the given code to create an interactive map visualizing buildings on UBC-V Campus. 

There are 4 basic componant to a Leaflet web map: **Tiles**, **Data**, **Style**, and **Interaction**. These work in concert to power a functioning web map. Over the course of the Hands-On activities that follow, you will have a chance to experiment with each component.
