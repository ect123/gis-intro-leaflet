# Hands On: Build Your Own Web Map

# Putting it into Perspective
Before we start working on our map, let’s just put things into perspective: This is an introductory workshop meant to get you started with the tools and skills to move forward on your own. Within the greater web mapping ecosystem context, we’re touching on the essentials. To give you an idea of where this workshop fits into that ecosystem, take a look at this diagram from [Maptime](http://maptime.io/). Note the .html document and the internet browser.
## Software Used
We'll use two pieces of software - a web browser, which will render/display your map, and a source code editor to edit that map.
## Development Environment
First things first, let's set up your development environment which includes the two pieces of software, and a method for you to access them both efficiently. One option is to split your screen in half - web browser on one side and the code editor on another. Or, you can move from one application tab to another by minimizing windows. It's totally your call, and the point is to find out what works best for you.
