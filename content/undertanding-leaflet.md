# Understanding Leaflet

So, what exactly is Leaflet? Leaflet is a set of instructions that your web browser or mobile device uses to display maps and let you interact with them. So like when you double click a mouse on a map, leaflet tells your browser to zoom in. Leaflet defines the style of your map - and includes things like zoom controls, attribution links, colors for markers on top of the map, etc. It is made up of only 38kb of Javascript, so it is really fast and lightweight - meaning browsers donâ€™t have to work very hard to load it. It is open source, free, and hugely customizable. And because of all of that it is really widely used. There are lots of alternative to Leaflet, but I think the one that is most widely used is Google Maps, which you need an API key to use.
### As Code
Technically, Leaflet consists of JavaScript and CSS code libraries which power the ways your web browser interprets and interacts with geospatial data, displays colors and style. For instance, when you double click a map to zoom in, Leaflet is at work. When you add data to your map, Leaflet assigns it a default color. And because Leaflet is open-source, the code is hugely customizable and extensible. [Here are some examples](https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html) of Leaflet-based plugins to give you some idea of the variety of added functionality that comes from the community of developers.

### In a Browser
Take a look at this basic [Leaflet map example](https://ect123.s3.amazonaws.com/map01.html). You can zoom in, pan around, etc. It's meant to be displayed in your internet browser or a mobile application, so it loads and responds to you quickly.
