# Map Style

The basic building blocks of the web -- **HTML and CSS** -- also play a role in the way your map looks. We'll be creating a static HTML document to display our map as a full page document, but we could change the formatting with html code if we wanted to. CSS can be used not only to customize our HTML document, but also our data. Styling our geographic data (aka digital cartography) so that it is accessible (see [coloring for colorblindness](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40)), helps convey a story, and looks good takes a lot of practice and talent. Expert digital cartographers are true artists.   

That said, we will rely on the Leaflet's built-in CSS rules for styling. However, in the future you can always customize these settings to fit the style of your own website or page.
