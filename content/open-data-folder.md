# Open Data in Code Editor

First open the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) application. Make sure your data folder is unzipped. To open `intro-leaflet-data` with VS Code, select Open... from the Welcome Page and navigate to your data folder is stored on your computer. Select it (but don't click into it) and hit Open.

Once opened, you should see two files in the Explorer panel of your code editor. `ubcbuildings.js` is the data file, and the `boilerplate.html` is the map boilerplate.
