# Introduction to Web Maps with Leaflet

## Introduction

This workshop is intended for anyone interested in getting started with creating web maps, aimed at a beginner-level, and meant to be given in a lab setting. We will use [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) as a base for understanding how web maps work. There are two main sections: an intro to web maps, and a hands-on where code is copy/pasted to make interactive maps. The goal is to develop essential skills and knowledge to get started, and provide an opportunity to ask questions (in person). As a bonus, students will create and have boilerplate code to be built upon and tinkered with at a later time.    
#### Software used     
- **Internet browser (and an internet connection)**. The most recent versions of [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org) and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) are the recommended browsers.
- **Source code editor**. To make your life easier while viewing or editing code, it's good to use a [source code editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor). This workshop uses [Atom](https://atom.io/) for screenshots, but other editors like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) will work similarly.

#### Prerequisites
Making maps is hard. And without practice, working in the web is hard too. While there are no actual prerequisites for the in person workshop, these things would be good to know before jumping right in, or to refer to later:

- **Intro level knowledge of computer programming**. [Matt Adesanya's *A Gentler Introduction to Programming*](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-gentler-introduction-to-programming-1f57383a1b2c/) is a great starting point, and will be more than you need for this workshop.
- **Intro level knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. [Sololearn.com offers several courses on these topics and more](https://www.sololearn.com/Courses/), but there are several other educational resources to choose from on the web if you prefer something different. You'er not expected to be a pro for this workshop, but understanding these concepts will provide some very useful perspective.
- **Understanding of basic cartographic design concepts**. What is map making without a consideration of cartography? Axis Maps has written a phenomenal [short guide to cartography](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/), and [the web map module](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/web/should-a-map-be-interactive/) is especially relevant.
